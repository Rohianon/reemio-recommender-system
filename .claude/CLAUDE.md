# Reemio Recommender System - Claude Code Instructions

## Code Style

### No Code Comments
- NEVER add code comments to any code files (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Code should be self-documenting through clear variable names, function names, and structure
- Only add comments where the logic is genuinely non-obvious and cannot be made clearer through refactoring
- Do not add docstrings, inline comments, or explanatory comments to code you write or modify
- Exception: Keep existing docstrings for public APIs and functions that are part of the public interface

### Python
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Prefer descriptive variable and function names over comments
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

### General
- Write clean, readable code that doesn't need comments to understand
- Focus on clarity through naming and structure, not through commentary
